# Shape-Detection-with-CNN
Creating and Deploying a Real-time 4-Shape Recognition Model with CNN, Pooling, Dropout, and Webcam Integration

---

### Introduction

This project is a real-time shape recognition model that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), pooling layers, dropout, and image preprocessing techniques to identify four different shapes: circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles. In addition to the model, we've integrated it with a webcam to enable live shape detection. This text provides an overview of the project and its components, explaining how to use, and deploy it, and is intended to be uploaded to GitHub as a documentation for other developers or interested parties.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: We have prepared a dataset containing labeled images of the four shapes. We preprocess the images by resizing them to a consistent size, converting them to grayscale, and normalizing them for improved model performance.

2. **Model Architecture**: Our model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The final output layer uses softmax activation to classify shapes.

3. **Training the Model**: We've trained the model using the preprocessed dataset. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the classification loss.

4. **Webcam Integration**: To enable real-time shape detection, we've implemented webcam integration using OpenCV. The model processes video frames from the webcam, making predictions on detected shapes.

5. **User Interface**: We provide a simple user interface that displays the webcam feed and overlays shape predictions in real-time.

### Dependencies

The project relies on several libraries and frameworks, including:

- Python: The main programming language for the project.
- TensorFlow/Keras: Used for building and training the CNN model.
- OpenCV: Utilized for webcam integration and video processing.
- Numpy: For array manipulation and numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: Used for displaying images and results.
- Other standard Python libraries.

### Usage

To use the project:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/punyamodi/Shape-Detection-with-CNN/blob/main/4-shapes-100-accuracy%20(1)%20(1).ipynb`

2. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can typically use pip to install them.

3. Train the model: If you have a new dataset, you can retrain the model by running the training script. If you'd like to use our pre-trained model, you can download it from the project's releases section on GitHub.

4. Run the real-time shape detection script. This will start your webcam and display the live feed with shape predictions.

### Future Improvements

1. **Improved Model Performance**: You can enhance the model's accuracy by collecting more diverse training data or fine-tuning hyperparameters.

2. **Support for Additional Shapes**: Extend the project to recognize more shapes by expanding the dataset and updating the model architecture.

3. **Object Localization**: Implement object localization to not only classify shapes but also locate their positions within the frame.

### Conclusion

This project showcases a real-time shape recognition system utilizing CNNs, pooling, dropout, and webcam integration. It serves as a foundation for further computer vision applications and can be easily extended or integrated into other projects. Feel free to contribute, use, or modify it according to your needs.
